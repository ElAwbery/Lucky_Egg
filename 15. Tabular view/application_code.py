"""
The render_template function is updated to make a template for an HTML  
tabular single page view of all Pok√©mon in in all familes. The table includes
update boxes for pokemon species counts and first stage pokemon candies. 
Each pokemon species name in the table links to its own page view. 
Each species page view has an added link to view the AllPokemon page. 

An all_pokemon css stylesheet is added to the pokemon_handler class. Css is 
now extensive enough that later versions will split it out into a separate 
file. 

get_router and post_router methods have been updated to include requests for 
AllPokemon and its updates.

The pokemon class status line attribute of previous versions is removed. 
Status lines are now template variables updated in the get_router
and post_router methods.  

"""

"""
Application_code module constructs the web page view. 

Application code consists of two ORM_object subclasses, pokemon_family and 
pokemon_species. 

This application code must comply with the database ORM: the Pokemon database 
mirrors the subclass structure with two tables.

The ORM_object class relies on table names in the database being identical to
its subclass names and the column headings in the tables being identical to the
subclass data attributes.

Thus our subclass data attributes are identical to our database table 
column names.

The pokemon_family subclass keeps track of candy counts and family members 
which are pokemon_species objects. 

The pokemon_species subclass keeps track of individual pokemon counts.  
    
The pokemon_species subclass has data attributes UID, family, name and count 
and the pokemon_family subclass has data attributes UID (a family ID distinct from
the UID of the individual pokemon species), candies, baby, first_stage, 
second_stage and third_stage. 

The family column in the pokemon_species table contains a family UID that is
a foreign key. The pokemon stages columns in the pokemon_family table 
have foreign key constraints to individual species' UIDs in the pokemon_species 
table.   

Our application code calls the server and talks to it with an 
HTTPRequestHandler subclass,'pokemon_handler'. Its get_router and post_router 
methods handle application specific page construction. These constitute the
controller of the MVC architecture.
